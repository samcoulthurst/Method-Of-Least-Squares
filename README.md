# Method-Of-Least-Squares

Given a data set with n data points this program finds the line or curve of best fit by minimising the square of the residuals. It can find the curve of best fit as a polynomial of any order you would like. Also returns the coefficients of the equation of the line/curve of best fit in the form of a numpy array.
